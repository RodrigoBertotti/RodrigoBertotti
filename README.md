Hi there :raising_hand_man: I'm [Rodrigo Jo√£o Bertotti](https://wisetap.com/en), Full-Stack App developer

I consider myself a developer who always thinks ahead,
considering how the new feature will behave in different scenarios, so 
we can scale the project avoiding unexpected behaviors

Experience with:
